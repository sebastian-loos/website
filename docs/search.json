    "text": "In today’s rapidly evolving educational landscape, the role of learners has shifted from passive observers to active, if not proactive, participants. This change in perspective has necessitated a transformation in the ways we impart knowledge and skills (Daniela 2020).\nEmerging technologies, such as virtual reality (VR) and mixed reality (XR), hold immense potential in reshaping learning environments and facilitating effective training, transcending the limitations of traditional methods. A crucial dimension of this investigation lies in exploring the applicability of mixed reality in training programs, particularly in resource-constrained settings.\nThe focus lies on severe e-waste issues that ask for innovative, cost-effective, and sustainable training methods, given the environmental and health concerns associated with informal e-waste recycling practices (Forti et al. 2020). Analyses on the have underscored the effectiveness of XR technologies in training contexts, especially when traditional methods prove impractical due to factors like danger and cost (Kaplan et al. 2021; Xie et al. 2021).\nThe convergence of these insights underlines the pressing need to assess and harness mixed reality’s potential for training in resource-constrained settings, thereby addressing critical skill gaps, promoting sustainable practices, and facilitating a brighter future for learners in resource-constrained settings.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nDaniela, Linda. 2020.
